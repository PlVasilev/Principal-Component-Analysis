### Principal Component Analysis - Review 

#### Content
1. Introduction
2. Load data
3. Standardization of the data
4. Construct the covariance matrix
5. Decompose the covariance matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
6. Sort the eigenvalues by decreasing order to rank the corresponding eigenvectors.
7. Explained variance - select k eigenvectors which correspond to the k largest eigenvalues, where k is the dimensionality of the new feature subspace (k ≤ d).
8. Projection Matrix - Construct a projection matrix W from the “top” k eigenvectors
9. Transform the d-dimensional input dataset X using the projection matrix W to obtain the new k-dimensional feature subspace
10. PCA implementation
11. PCA application example
12. Conclusion
13. References
